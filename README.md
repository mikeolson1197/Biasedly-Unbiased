News is biased and that's okay. It's not okay to get your news from one place.

Every news outlet has bias. It’s impossible to avoid it. In fact, I think it’s good to have an opinion as a news organization. By it’s nature, reporting the news offers a take on something that’s happening in the world. News outlets that claim to be unbiased are trying to hide their voice. They should embrace and recognize their opinion. If people want become unbiased, they should try to read as many biased opinions as possible. That’s the point of biasedly unbiased.
